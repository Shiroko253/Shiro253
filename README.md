# Shiroko253 — Personal Website & Blog

Hello, I’m **Shiroko253** — but you can also call me **Shiro** or **Miya**.

Welcome to my personal website, which also works as a small blog of mine.  
Maybe you don’t know me yet, but if you do, you probably know that I’m a **Discord bot developer** — just one among the thousands out there, a very ordinary one who often prefers to stay quiet.

## 👾 About My Bot — Saigyouji Yuyuko

Let me introduce my bot: **Saigyouji Yuyuko**.  
She’s a character from the *Touhou Project* — a ghost princess.  
The moment I first saw her, I fell in love with her immediately. Yes, it’s basically the concept of “creating your own virtual waifu” — nothing wrong with that.

As for features… there are many.  
Feel free to explore the source code here:

Thanks for stopping by.  
I hope you have a wonderful day!
