Hello, I’m **Shiroko253** — but you can also call me **Shiro** or **Miya**.

Welcome to my personal website, which also serves as a small blog of mine.  
Maybe you don’t know me yet, but if you do, you probably know that I’m a  
**Discord bot developer** — just one among thousands, a very ordinary one who often stays quiet.

## 👾 About My Bot — Saigyouji Yuyuko

Let me introduce my bot: **Saigyouji Yuyuko**.  
She’s a character from the *Touhou Project* — a ghost princess.  
The moment I first saw her, I fell in love immediately.  
Yes, it’s basically “creating your own virtual waifu” — and that’s perfectly fine.

As for features… there are many. Feel free to explore the source code:

**Have a wonderful day!**
